Module 20 Credit Risk Challenge


The purpose of this analysis is to create a machine learning model that can access loan risk. Using the main factors of loan size, interest rate, borrowers income and current debt to income ratio the data was split into test and train and a Logistic Regression model created. Accuracy was then calculated with the assistance of a confusion matrix.

The model does very well (in fact 100%) in predicting healthy loans but not so well (87% preciscion) with the high risk loan. It would most likely be better to have this the other way around. So at first it would appear that this model should not be recommended. However it should not be ruled out without implicit domain knowledge. Afterall maybe the 87% preciscion is beeter than where the bank is currently tracking. So while not perfect it may give them gains over current practice.
